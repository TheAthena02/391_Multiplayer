1v1 fps duel arena. Hit scan guns with limited ammo. Skill expression in reloading, reloading takes an involved process of clicking buttons and moving the mouse simple, blocky art style with robot characters that fall apart when destroyed. Guns will be futuristic, and almost rude Goldberg machines to reload. The game will be online multiplayer and will feature locally hosted multiplayer. The environment will be using the base unity networking system for ease of access and simplicity. AI will be avoided for the most part, unless advice on scripting is needed outside of Michael Cassen's office time.Â
