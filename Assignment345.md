The above Zip file contains the full unity project.

## Assignment 3
- This assignment contains a unique UUID created. It also has a username and password login system.
- This is primarily code from class. Some troubleshooting with AI, though the issues solved were not directly by AI.
- This code can be found in ButtonTest, and is implemented in LoginScene

## Assignment 4
- This assignment encorporates fixed-point location, tick-based updates, and fixed update time. It also introduces a movement script. All of these are at once, meaning there is a lot of delay.
- This code is a combination of example code, handwritten code, and AI enhancements.
- This code is found in HelloWorldPlayer, and elements like Unity's NetworkManager, Transport, and HelloWorldManager need to be reenabled.

## Assignment 5
- This assignment encorporates Mirror, Latency Mitigation, and Tick Based updates with Mirror. It took me wayyyyy to long to realize this replaced the Unity Networking systems.
- This code is mostly the application of example code, though I did hand implement the tick system from before.
- This code is found in NetworkPlayerController.
